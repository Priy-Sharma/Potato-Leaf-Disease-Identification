<h1>Potato Leaf Disease Identification</h1>
<p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras to identify and classify potato leaf diseases. The dataset used in this project includes images of potato leaves categorized into three classes:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Potato_Early_blight</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Potato_Late_blight</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Potato_healthy</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The project demonstrates how to preprocess image data, build a CNN model, train it, and evaluate its performance for classifying potato leaf diseases. The Jupyter Notebook includes code for data loading, model building, training, and evaluation, along with visualizations of the results.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook:</p>

<h3>1. Clone the Repository</h3>


git clone https://github.com/Priy-Sharma/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Identification.git

<p>This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.</p>

<h3>2. Install Required Libraries</h3>
<p>Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using pip:</p>

pip install -r requirements.txt
 <h3>3. Open the Jupyter Notebook</h3>
 <p>Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the following file:</p>

Potato_Leaf_Disease_Identifier.ipynb
<p>Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code and analyze the results.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project contains images of potato leaves, categorized into three classes:</p>
The source of data is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village
<ul>
        <li><strong>Potato_Early_blight</strong> - Images of potato leaves affected by early blight.</li>
        <li><strong>Potato_Late_blight</strong> - Images of potato leaves affected by late blight.</li>
        <li><strong>Potato_healthy</strong> - Images of healthy potato leaves.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Ensure that the dataset is correctly organized and placed in the appropriate directory as specified in the notebook.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to use the model:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Ensure you have all the required libraries installed.</li>
        <li>Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to preprocess the data, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.</li>
        <li>Review the visualizations and evaluation metrics to understand the model's performance.</li>
</ul>
